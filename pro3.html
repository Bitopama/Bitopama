    <h2 class="section-title">Channel Portfolio and Conversion Insights</h2>
    
    <h3 class="section-subtitle">Introduction</h3>
    <p class="section-description">
        This analysis focused on evaluating the performance of various marketing channels, emphasizing user engagement via session trends and conversion rates for an e-commerce platform. The analysis included traffic sources, device types, and campaign strategies, using MySQL for data extraction and manipulation.
    </p>

    <!-- Channel Portfolio Analysis -->
    <h3>1. Channel Portfolio Analysis</h3>
    <p>To assess marketing channels' effectiveness, I analyzed UTM content to identify channels with the highest session counts and orders.</p>
    <pre class="code-block">
SELECT ws.utm_content, COUNT(DISTINCT ws.website_session_id) AS sessions, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT o.website_session_id) AS orders,
       (COUNT(DISTINCT o.website_session_id) / COUNT(DISTINCT ws.website_session_id)) AS conversion_rate
FROM website_sessions ws
LEFT JOIN orders o ON ws.website_session_id = o.website_session_id
WHERE ws.created_at BETWEEN '2014-01-01' AND '2014-02-01'
GROUP BY ws.utm_content
ORDER BY conversion_rate DESC;
    </pre>
    <p>Findings: Certain UTM content types were top performers in generating sessions and orders, particularly Google Ad-1. The conversion rates highlighted the value of targeted messaging.</p>

    <!-- Session Volume Trends -->
    <h3>2. Session Volume Trends: Google Search vs. Bing Search</h3>
    <p>To compare Google Search and Bing Search session volume trends weekly for non-brand campaigns:</p>
    <pre class="code-block">
SELECT MIN(DATE(created_at)) AS start_of_week,
       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source = "gsearch" THEN website_session_id END) AS gsearch,
       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source = "bsearch" THEN website_session_id END) AS bsearch
FROM website_sessions 
WHERE created_at BETWEEN '2012-08-22' AND '2012-11-29' 
      AND utm_campaign = "nonbrand"
GROUP BY WEEK(created_at);
    </pre>
    <p>Findings: Google Search consistently outperformed Bing in session volume, showing its value as a primary traffic source for non-brand campaigns.</p>

    <!-- Device Type Analysis -->
    <h3>3. Device Type Analysis for Non-Brand Campaigns</h3>
    <p>Session volume segmented by device type for Google and Bing searches:</p>
    <pre class="code-block">
SELECT utm_source,
       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type = "mobile" THEN website_session_id END) AS mobile_sessions,
       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type = "desktop" THEN website_session_id END) AS desktop_sessions
FROM website_sessions
WHERE created_at BETWEEN '2012-08-22' AND '2012-11-30' 
      AND utm_campaign = "nonbrand"
GROUP BY utm_source;
   </pre>
    <p>Findings: Higher sessions on desktop for Google Search.</p>

    <!-- Conversion Rates by Device Type -->
    <h3>4. Conversion Rates by Device Type</h3>
    <p>Exploring conversion rates by device type for Google and Bing searches:</p>
    <pre class="code-block">
SELECT ws.device_type, ws.utm_source,
       COUNT(DISTINCT ws.website_session_id) AS sessions,
       COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS orders,
       COUNT(DISTINCT o.website_session_id) / COUNT(DISTINCT ws.website_session_id) AS conversion_rates
FROM website_sessions ws
LEFT JOIN orders o ON ws.website_session_id = o.website_session_id
WHERE ws.created_at >= '2012-08-22' AND ws.created_at < '2012-09-18'
      AND ws.utm_campaign = "nonbrand"
GROUP BY ws.device_type, ws.utm_source;
   </pre>
    <p>Findings: Overall desktop sessions surpassed mobile sessions with Google Search having the highest conversion rate.</p>

    <!-- Direct Traffic and Conversion Analysis -->
    <h3>5. Direct Traffic and Conversion Analysis</h3>
    <p>Analyzing direct traffic conversion rates by month:</p>
    <pre class="code-block">
SELECT YEAR(created_at) AS yr, MONTH(created_at) AS mo,
       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_campaign = "nonbrand" THEN website_session_id END) AS nonbrand,
       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_campaign = "brand" THEN website_session_id END) AS brand,
       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_campaign = "brand" THEN website_session_id END) / 
       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_campaign = "nonbrand" THEN website_session_id END) AS brand_pct_of_nonbrand,
       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source IS NULL AND http_referer IS NULL THEN website_session_id END) AS direct_type,
       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source IS NULL AND http_referer IS NULL THEN website_session_id END) / 
       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_campaign = "nonbrand" THEN website_session_id END) AS direct_pct_of_nonbrand,
       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source IS NULL AND http_referer = "https://www.gsearch.com" THEN website_session_id END) AS organic_g_type,
       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source IS NULL AND http_referer = "https://www.gsearch.com" THEN website_session_id END) /

       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_campaign = "nonbrand" THEN website_session_id END) AS direct_ob_of_nonbrand
FROM website_sessions
GROUP BY 1, 2;
    </pre>
    <p>Findings: Direct traffic as a fraction of non-brand campaigns grew from 5% in 2012 to 16% in 2015, indicating stronger user engagement and loyalty. Similarly, an increase in organic search traffic over the years reflects improved brand from 0.38% to 15% recognition and visibility.</p>
